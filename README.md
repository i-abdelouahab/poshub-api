# üöÄ poshub-api

A minimal and extensible FastAPI service for managing orders with internal/external integrations.

---

## üß∞ Project Setup

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- Python ‚â• 3.10
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- (Optional) `pre-commit` for code linting

### üîß Install dependencies

```bash
poetry 
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run locally (development)

```bash
poetry run uvicorn poshub_api.main:app --reload
```

Visit: [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)

---

## üß™ Running Tests

- Sync tests with `TestClient`
- Async tests with `pytest-asyncio`

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

> External calls are mocked via [`respx`](https://github.com/lundberg/respx).

## üìÅ Project Structure Approaches

FastAPI is flexible in how you structure your code. Below are **three common options** for scalable backend services:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Flat / Minimal (for quick PoCs)

```
src/
  poshub_api/
    main.py
    models.py
    routes.py
    services.py
  tests/
    test_services.py
    ...
```

- ‚úÖ Easy for beginners and fast to prototype  
- ‚ùå Becomes hard to maintain in growing codebases

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Layered / Domain-Centric ‚úÖ (Chosen for this project)

```
src/
  poshub_api/
    main.py
    api/
      routers/
        orders.py
    domain/
      models.py
      entities.py
    services/
      order_service.py
    infrastructure/
      http/
        external_client.py
    shared/
      exceptions.py
      dependencies.py
      logger.py
  tests/
    services/
      test_order_service.py
    ...
```

- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns (API, domain, infra, shared)  
- ‚úÖ Scales well for mid-to-large projects  
- ‚ùå Slightly more verbose setup

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature-Based / Modular

```
src/
  poshub_api/
    main.py
    modules/
      orders/
        router.py
        models.py
        service.py
      users/
        router.py
        models.py
    shared/
      config.py
  tests/
    orders/
      test_service.py
    ...
      
```

- ‚úÖ Modules are independent and testable  
- ‚úÖ Good fit for microservice-aligned architectures  
- ‚ùå Some code duplication if not managed well
